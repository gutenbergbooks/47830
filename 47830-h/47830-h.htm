</div>

  <h2 class='c010'><span class='large'>ACT I</span></h2>

<p class='c011'><i>The</i> <span class='sc'>Burgomaster’s</span> <i>study, a large and
very comfortably furnished room on
the first floor of the house, used partly
as an office, and partly as a horticultural
laboratory. Leather easy-chairs,
a glass book-case. A large
table laden with papers and with
vases, dishes and baskets full of
flowers and fruit: orchids, peaches,
plums and magnificent bunches of
grapes. In the various corners, a
grandfather’s clock, garden-tools, pulverizers,
retorts, test-tubes, bee-hives,
etc. At the back, a French window
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>opening on a balcony. On the right
a heavy door.</i></p>

<p class='c012'><i>As the</i> <span class='sc'>Curtain</span> <i>rises, the</i> <span class='sc'>Municipal
Secretary</span> <i>is writing at a corner of
the table</i>. <span class='sc'>Enter</span>, <i>on the right</i>,
<span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span>. <i>He is dressed in ill-fitting
peasant’s clothes, and carries
his arm in a sling.</i></p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Good-morning, Mr. Secretary.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Good-morning. What can I do for
you?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>(<i>Going nearer.</i>) Don’t you know me,
old friend?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Why, it’s you, Jean! The last man I
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>expected to see! Where have you come
from? I say, you’re wounded!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Yes, a bullet in the arm.... I got it
outside Aerschot. They put me into hospital
at Winkel, but the Germans entered
the town yesterday and, as I could walk, I
didn’t wait for them to take me prisoner.
I got into these clothes, cleared out, spent
part of the night in a ditch, tramped three
hours across country and here I am at Stilemonde.
I must be off at once, though, and
try and catch up my carabineers, who ought
to be somewhere near Overloop.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>You look tired. Does the arm hurt?
And you’re soaked through!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Yes. The arm’s not much, or rather it
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>wasn’t. To-day, somehow, I seem to feel
it more.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>That’s because you’re tired. You must
rest a little and have your wound seen to.
We’ll find you a bed somewhere, either at
my place or here, which is God’s own
house.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It’s not a question of resting, it’s not a
question of bed; they’ll be here before the
morning’s over.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Who?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Germans! There are Uhlans
everywhere along the roads; and I expect
the main body isn’t far behind.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Impossible! We’ve heard nothing of
that here; but of course the communications
have all been cut.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Where’s the Burgomaster?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I’m waiting for him. He’s in one of
the glass-houses. The storm last night
seems to have done some damage. He’ll
be here in a minute: the man has gone to
find him. Would you like to speak to
him?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I’ve a message from the Burgomaster of
Winkel, advising him to be very careful
and, above all, to see that no arms are
found in the town.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We’ve seen to all that; we’ve done
everything. All the arms, even the
trophies and curios, have been put away
in the Town-hall and locked up in a room
of which I’ve got the key.... So they’re
at Winkel, are they?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Yes, three or four hundred. I was told
that the master’s son-in-law was at the head
of them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The master? Who?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Yours, the Burgomaster of Stilemonde.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Otto Hilmer? Impossible!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Yes, that was the name: Lieutenant Hilmer.
So it’s true then? I wouldn’t believe
it. Did the Burgomaster’s daughter
marry a German?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Of course she did; why not? We were
not very fond of the Germans here; but,
after all, they did us no harm; on the contrary....
It was before the war, when
nobody thought of these things. As luck
would have it, poor Madame van Belle,
the master’s wife, died a year before the
wedding. It would never have happened
had she been alive, for she loathed the
Prussians; and if she could see what they
are doing to-day! But what a blow it will
be to the master! Is Lieutenant Otto
likely to be coming here?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Sure to. At least, so he told the Burgomaster
at Winkel.... But how did that
marriage come about?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In the most natural way. How was one
to know that some fine day the Germans
would come and massacre us and do all the
dreadful things that people are talking
about ... if they’re true?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>They’re true enough; and what you’ve
heard isn’t the worst.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Dreadful! But who could have thought
it!... You see, Monsieur van Belle, our
Burgomaster, went to Germany now and
again on business. They made a great
fuss of him there and treated him royally.
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>At Cologne they made him the president of
all the local horticultural societies. He
had known the Hilmer family a long time
and used to stay with Otto’s parents whenever
he went to Cologne.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Are they well off, the Hil—what did
you say the name was?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Hilmers. They’ve got a factory in
the Rhine Province: electrical machinery;
it’s the biggest factory in the place. Well,
young Hilmer, who’s now Lieutenant Otto,
wanted to learn about cultivation of orchids
and hot-house grapes, which happens
to be the specialty of Van Belle and Co.
And Monsieur van Belle’s son was keen on
electricity only. So they paired off: young
Van Belle went to Cologne and Otto came
here.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>How long ago was that?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Nearly two years.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>And where is young Van Belle now?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He was at Cologne when war was declared;
but there’s a rumour that he managed
to escape. We’ve heard nothing definite,
though, and are very uneasy.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>And the other? How did he get back
to Germany?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I don’t know. He must have got wind
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>of it somehow. He left us suddenly, at
the end of July, gave out that his mother
was ill.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>That shows again that they knew what
was going to happen and were preparing
for it. And, as <i>he</i> had been warned, he
might at least have done the same by his
father-in-law and still more by his wife’s
brother.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>You see, those people aren’t like us.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Or rather we’re not like them, thank
Heaven!... Have they been married
long?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Close on six months.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Are they happy?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>They worshipped each other. And
one’s got to be fair. Otto is a very pleasant,
good-hearted fellow, very kind, and
liked doing people a good turn. Worked
very hard. Polite to everybody. Clever
too, very. Nothing really to be said
against him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Except that he’s a German; and that’s
quite enough.... And how does his wife
take it all?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>She’s very much upset, of course; and
that’s bad, because, as I hear, she is at this
moment—you understand. However, it’s
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>not certain yet.... She is very restless,
very depressed, but she doesn’t say anything:
she was never one to talk much.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He’s dreadfully worried. At first, he
was quite bowled over. He simply refused
to believe it. Then he was furious, wild,
beside himself. But he calmed down after
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>a bit: you see, he was always something of
an optimist; and now he’s beginning to
think that things will be settled very soon.
But here he is.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>

<p class='c009'>As well as can be, after working all

<p class='c009'>Is everything settled at the Town-hall?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Yes, Mr. Burgomaster. All the arms
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>have been stored there; I drew up a list
myself and gave the receipts.... But let
me introduce my old friend Jean Gilson,
who’s been wounded at Aerschot. He was
in hospital at Winkel when the Germans
entered the town yesterday; he managed to
escape last night.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>(<i>Shaking hands with</i> <span class='sc'>Gilson</span>.) So you
were at Aerschot?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Yes, I was a sergeant in the battalion of
carabineers which covered the retreat.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Was it much of a fight?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Yes. Two-thirds of the battalion were
killed or wounded. There are always
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>three of them to one of us; and we had no
guns. We held our ground as long as we
could; then we were obliged to fall back.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>You look dreadfully tired and must be
starving! Pierre, my dear fellow, why on
earth didn’t you...? (<i>He rings.</i>)
I’ll tell him myself. (<i>Enter the</i> <span class='sc'>Footman</span>.)
Firmin, bring up some cold meat;
bring anything you’ve got downstairs:
bread, butter, eggs, cheese. What cold
meat is there?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Footman</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Veal and chicken, sir; ham, tongue.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>All right, bring them all. And as to
drink.... (<i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span>.) What
wine do you like? I’ve a splendid Rudesheimer
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>and an ’82 white port which you
won’t quarrel with. Which would you
like? (<i>To the</i> <span class='sc'>Footman</span>.) Look here,
bring both, that’s simpler. (<i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Jean
Gilson</span>.) You can manage a couple of
bottles, I dare say. If necessary we’ll
lend you a hand, eh, Mr. Secretary? It
will be so much less left for the Germans.
There’s fruit enough, as you see. These
pears, these plums and peaches are of my
own growing; look at the grapes I have
just picked; did you ever see anything like
them? They’re my special achievement:
a variety I got by slowly and patiently
crossing the Black Alicante, which is magnificent
to look at but hasn’t much flavour,
with a Sicilian muscat that’s very small but
delicious. I’ve secured what’s best in
both of them and kept out what’s bad.
Just taste them: aren’t they wonderful?
They’re hard and yet they’re juicy; they
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>just melt as you crush them with your
teeth. Each one is like a drop of wine
with a touch of snow in it. I shall be putting
over four thousand pounds of these
grapes on the market every week in five
years or so. You’ve been the first to have
a taste of them.... So they’re at Winkel,
are they?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Yes, Mr. Burgomaster; and they’ll be
here this morning. I’m just a bit ahead
of them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Secretary</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Jean tells me that they’re led by Mr.
Otto, your son-in-law.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>What, Otto? Impossible! Were you
told that? Did you see him?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I didn’t see him, but that’s what I was
told. There were three officers at Winkel,
a major and two lieutenants; Otto
Hilmer was one. I hear that he said he
was coming to occupy Stilemonde with a
detachment of the 62nd Foot.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Yes, he was a lieutenant in the reserve.
It’s odd that he should have dared....
But no, in point of fact he’s right. He
has done the right thing, he will arrange
matters and we shall have nothing to fear.
All the same, it’s rather extraordinary.
My own son-in-law comes into my town as
a conqueror, booted and helmeted, with
his sword drawn, after violating the frontier
of his adopted country.... However,
it’s war; and he can’t help it. He’s
not responsible and he can’t do what he
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>likes. Besides, it’s all the better for us:
as long as he’s here, we’ve nothing to be
afraid of.... How are they behaving
at Winkel? I hope they haven’t done
much harm?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>They hadn’t when I left. They took
the burgomaster, the priest and the notary
as hostages and declared that they would
kill them if a single shot was fired in the
village.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>They won’t do that, thanks to Otto.
Otto is a kind-hearted chap, who wouldn’t
hurt a soul. Besides, I feel certain that
their massacres and atrocities have been
greatly exaggerated; after all, they’re not
savages.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I beg your pardon, Mr. Burgomaster,
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>there has been no exaggeration at all; on
the contrary, we haven’t heard everything
yet. What they did at Andenne, at Dinant,
at Louvain, at Aerschot and at every
town they came to is simply appalling.
As for the massacres at Dinant and Louvain,
I’ve got that at first hand: two of
my men saw it with their own eyes. At
Louvain, they executed two hundred and
ten innocent people, including twenty-four
women and fourteen children; at Dinant,
six hundred and six, including thirty-nine
children and seventy-one women; at Aerschot,
they shot the burgomaster and his
son of fifteen, with many other entirely
harmless and defenceless citizens.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then it’s true that there have been military
executions? I didn’t believe it....
And what excuse did they make?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>

<p class='c009'>Their colonel had been killed by a stray
bullet, fired by one of their own men.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>

</div>

<p class='c009'>The devil! They’re dangerous then!
But we must have none of that here.
(<i>Enter the</i> <span class='sc'>Footman</span>.) Here’s Firmin
with the tray: sandwiches and the two
bottles. (<i>Filling the glasses.</i>) This is
my ’95 Rudesheimer. Tell me what you

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>You’re right. (<i>Exit the</i> <span class='sc'>Footman</span>.)
This is one of a lot of fifty dozen, which
I bought at the sale of Von Hulthem the
notary, who had the best cellar in these
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>parts.... But what do you mean to do
now? You can’t go off like this, you
know. You must have a few days’ rest
here; and we’ll dress your wound properly;
it doesn’t do to trifle with a thing
like that.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jean Gilson</span></div>

<p class='c009'>Nothing would suit me better. I’m

you if they find me under your roof.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes. (<i>Presenting the</i> <span class='sc'>Burgomaster</span>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Burgomaster, we shall occupy the
town until further orders. You will have
to find billets for two hundred and fifty
men. For the present you will not be
called upon to feed them. My two officers
and I will ask leave to take up our
quarters in your house. I know the ties
that unite you to one of them. I hope that,
thanks to these good relations, there will
be no difficulties between us. Nevertheless,
as is customary, considering the bad
spirit which the civil population have hitherto
displayed and in accordance with the
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>formal instructions which I have received,
I am obliged to look upon you as a hostage.
If unfortunately—which Heaven forbid—an
attempt were made upon the life of
one of my officers or men, your own life
would answer for it. But we need not, I
trust, contemplate any such deplorable contingencies.
If the civilians behave properly,
they have nothing to fear. Whatever
people may say, we are not barbarians.
We are, above all things, just; but
the necessities of war oblige us to be sometimes
severe and always on our guard. In
an hour from now I will send for you to
the Town-hall to discuss the question of
supplies and to fix the war-levy.</p>

<p class='c009'>That’s truer than you think. She began

<p class='c009'>Look here, Otto, I know you for an
intelligent, conscientious and thoroughly
honest man. You have lived among us
and you know what sort of people we are.
How can you stand there and seriously
utter such—I don’t know what word to
use, or, if I did, it wouldn’t be a pleasant
one. Let them tell that sort of humbug
to your wretched soldiers, or to a pack of
Junkers fuddled with pride and stupidity,
but not to a man like yourself! You know
the plain, terrible truth as well as I do,
just as you know what to think of the hideous
massacres at Vise, Andenne, Dinant,
Aerschot, Louvain and other places.</p>

<p class='c009'>Excuse me, it is not the same thing. I
admit that the violation of Belgium was a
regrettable incident; in my opinion it was
a mistake, necessary perhaps, from certain
points of view, but one which will cost us
dear. But I do not admit the massacres.
There have been executions of hostages
and reprisals necessitated by incessant acts
of treachery committed by the civil population.
Here and there, perhaps, there
has been some excess of zeal; that, unfortunately,
is inevitable. But I know the German
army better than you do, because I
belong to it; and it is the most highly disciplined
army in the world. It is extremely
rare, not to say impossible, for the
army to act without orders, or to overstep
the orders which it receives.</p>

<p class='c009'>It’s lucky that we’re alone. Don’t use

<p class='c009'>Very well, we won’t argue about it.
We shall never agree on these points nor

    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I also know what I know; and history

rather to get back to the feeling that united
us before this cataclysm, for which we are
not responsible.</p>

<p class='c009'>It’s a good thing that you at least do not
hold us to be responsible for the disaster
which your people have brought on us. I
thank you for that.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Why do you say such things to me? I
have absolutely nothing to do with what
has happened. Like the rest of us, I am
compelled to obey an authority which no
one can resist. I am a wheel in the machine.
I cannot act otherwise than I do.
But my feelings, my affections are just the
same as they were before the war! I persuaded
my superiors to send me here, so
that I might prove how grateful I am to
you....</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Please don’t continue in that tone: it is
not fair and it is extremely painful to me.
I simply wished, as I have told you, to
prove my gratitude by doing all I could to
save you, and the town of which you are
the chief authority, from the inconveniences
and dangers of an occupation which
I was unable to prevent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Very well, we won’t talk about it. How

    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c009'>We don’t know: perhaps two hours, perhaps
two months. It all depends on events
and on the orders which we receive.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>And the Major, what sort of a man is
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>he? He does not look easy to deal with.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He is severe, rather hard, rather dictatorial,
rather domineering, a strict disciplinarian,
but absolutely just; taken all round,
a good sort. I repeat, you have nothing
to fear, if your people behave themselves.
Besides, in the case of any conflict or misunderstanding,
I hope to use my influence
and to smooth matters down. And now
let us be friends, if you will, and allow me
to embrace you as I used to.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>

<p class='c009'>(<i>Stepping back.</i>) Forgive me....

    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>That’s strange; I simply can’t understand
it. After all, this war is no business
of ours; it’s over our heads; it’s beyond us.
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>However, I mustn’t take it ill of you; and
I can only say, like Antigone, “I take part
in love and not in hatred.” But what’s the
time? Eleven o’clock? Perhaps we
might let Isabelle know, if she really isn’t
ill? You can imagine how eager I am to
see her after this long separation and after
all that has happened.</p>

<p class='c009'>I will send the maid up to her. (<i>He

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>No, they did not let us know of their
plans, as they did you; <i>we</i> weren’t told
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>what they were going to do; and so he
stopped at Cologne. We are rather uneasy
about him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He is in no danger if he keeps quiet.
He will be interned in a concentration-camp.
I’ll write to my people and ask
them to see that he is well treated.... I
say, I see on your table one of those Cattleyas
which were rather sickly before I left.
How are they doing?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I believe they’re saved. I found out
under the microscope what it was that was
making them wither. It’s a tiny fungus
which no orchid-grower had located before
and against which all the ordinary methods
of vaporizing and fumigation are quite
useless. I’ve contrived a new blend; I’ll
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>give you the prescription; it has done wonderfully
well so far. I’m worried about
my poor hot-houses, on which I’ve spent
the best part of my life and nearly half
my fortune. If only this war doesn’t turn
them into broken glass and scrap-iron!
As you know, they contain nearly half a
million valuable flowers; and their destruction
would be an irretrievable disaster, for
it would take a whole lifetime to build up
a collection that could compare with mine.</p>

<p class='c009'>Have no fear, there will be no battle or

<p class='c009'>You see the hatred! Amazing! It’s
the same everywhere, all the time, wherever

they will not understand. I was conscious
of its existence even in the heart of your
father, who is the best-natured, fairest and
most tranquil-minded man I know. What
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>can we do, when they treat us like that?...
But we must keep an eye on the boy.
So long as he confines his offensive remarks
to me, there’s no great harm done, but it
would be a bad look out for him if he took
it into his head to treat the Major or Lieutenant

<p class='c009'>What do you call disaffected? They
are irritated, incensed, indignant, exasperated,
that’s natural enough; but they know
how to restrain themselves and are not such
fools as to attempt a useless murder, which
would entail the destruction of the town
and the death of hundreds of innocent victims,
as at Dinant, Andenne, Louvain and

</div>

<p class='c011'><i>The curtain rises on the the</i> <span class='sc'>Major</span>, <i>the</i>
<span class='sc'>Burgomaster</span>, <span class='sc'>Otto</span>, <i>the</i> <span class='sc'>Secretary</span>

<div class='nf-center c001'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Major</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Burgomaster, Lieutenant Karl von
Schaunberg has been murdered on your
premises, in your grounds. One of your
gardeners has been arrested near the spot
where the crime was committed. We may
therefore presume him to be the culprit.
In any case, I shall consider him such, until
I have proof to the contrary; and that is
enough. We must make an example; our
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>safety demands it; and our safety outweighs
all other considerations. In war-time,
the best form of justice is the promptest.
Your gardener, therefore, will be
shot at seven o’clock precisely, unless between
now and then you hand over the
person who, in your opinion, is the criminal.
You know the character and disposition
of your servants better than I do;
and you are therefore better able to discover
the malefactor. I have it in my
power to command the most terrible reprisals.
Any one else, in my place, would
have ordered the town to be pillaged and
set on fire and sentenced a third or a half
of the inhabitants to death. It would have
been more regular. Yielding to the
wishes of Lieutenant Otto Hilmer, I will
be satisfied with a single victim. Let me
have no cause to regret my clemency and
my moderation.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I repeat what I said to the men who
arrested him: it is quite impossible for old
Claus, my head-gardener, to have committed
the crime. He has been in my
service for over forty years; and I can answer
for him as I would for myself. He
is the gentlest of men, the most patient, the
most harmless. The reason why he was
found in the little wood where the Lieutenant
was killed is that the wood contains
a nursery-garden where I myself sent him,
this morning, to bud the rose-trees. He
had no weapons on him except his pruning-shears
and his grafting-knife. Besides, I
am convinced that, of all my servants and
workmen, Claus is perhaps the only one
who has never handled a gun or a revolver
in his life.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Major</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Burgomaster, you do not seem to
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>perceive that, by exonerating your head-gardener,
you are accusing and condemning
yourself. But I will not argue with you;
the enquiry is not my affair. Manage it
as you please; what I have said I have said.
I need a culprit; and that culprit has to be
shot at seven o’clock. It shall be whichever
of your men you choose to name; it
shall be yourself, if you give me no one
else. Meanwhile, please consider yourself
under arrest in your own house. It is
guarded; and any attempt at escape will be
pitilessly suppressed. I will let you know
at four o’clock the amount of the fine, over
and above the war-levy, which the town
will have to pay before twelve o’clock to-morrow
morning. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This is sheer lunacy! To expect me to
name the criminal among my servants,
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>when I know that it is physically impossible
for any of them to be guilty! And, if I
do not hand him over before this evening,
it means delivering myself to the firing-party!...
You must admit that this
Major of yours, with his “clemency” and
his “moderation,” has a very unpleasant
sense of humour. I would rather deal
with a brute who runs amuck and destroys
everything with fire and sword: then at
least I should know where I am.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>What would you have him do? As
things are, he can hardly act differently.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Isabelle</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Otto!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>But, after all, it’s true! You can see
for yourself, we are surrounded by enemies
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>and traitors; we are surrounded by hatred
on every side; we live in a perpetual trap;
our lives hang by a thread; and every one
of us can expect a bullet through his head
at any moment. It is only natural that we
should protect ourselves, when we are
treated like this! I think the Major’s decision
most reasonable, most fair, most humane.
He had the right, it was almost his
duty, in fact, to put the whole town to
death; and he is contented with a single
victim. Surely you can’t ask that a crime
of this sort should remain unpunished! It
would be the end of us! Besides, you will
easily find the criminal; you have only to
confirm the evidence that points to him.
The mere fact of his presence in the wood
implies so grave a presumption that you
will never destroy it, however hard you try.
All you have to do is to leave things alone
and not interfere. Then, if the Major is
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>wrong, the mistake will be on his head!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I can hardly believe my ears, Otto!
The war has altered you completely. You
know old Claus as well as I do. You
know that, of all men in my employment,
he alone most likely is absolutely incapable
of an act of this kind. If it were any one
else, I might have a doubt, I might say:
“Very well, perhaps. In war-time, you
can never tell.” But Claus! It’s as much
out of the question as though you suggested
that the shot had been fired by the child
which Isabelle is about to bring into the
world!... “A grave presumption!”
How dare you say that? You know why
the poor fellow was in the nursery-garden:
I sent him there myself, when he came to
take my orders at six o’clock this morning.
If I don’t do all that can be done to prove
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>his innocence, it is as though I myself were
commanding the firing-party....</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>And, if you do prove his innocence, you
will be putting yourself in his place, in front
of the firing-party.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Very well, I’d rather have it that way!...
But surely that isn’t possible.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It won’t be, unless you want it yourself.
We have ample time before us. It is almost
certain that the real criminal will be
discovered between now and this evening.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The real criminal? Do you know
where you’ve got to look for him?
Among your own men! It is simply one
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>of your soldiers who has taken the opportunity
to rid himself of an officer who ill-treated
him. You yourself told me, before
the Major came in, that Lieutenant
von Schaunberg was an insufferable lout
and that he was generally hated and
loathed.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I dare say; but it’s a far cry from that
to murder. In any case, I will myself
make enquiries on that side; you, on yours,
had better question Claus; he may give us
a clue that will prove useful.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I don’t mind, but I don’t expect much:
the poor man evidently knows nothing, or
he would have told me already. Between
ourselves, do you think the Major was
speaking seriously? Does he really mean
to place me in this awful dilemma and condemn
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>me to death if I refuse to surrender
an innocent man?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>You stand no chance whatever that way.
I have never known him to go back upon a
decision which he has once taken. There
is no hope of that at all; but there is every
hope elsewhere. We will all of us set to
work. You begin by questioning Claus;
I’ll go and see my men.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Isabelle</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>And may I go out?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>What for?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Isabelle</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>You can’t expect me to sit quiet while
my father’s life is at stake! I want to go
into the town, to see people, talk to them,
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>ask them questions, to do something!...
Surely our united efforts....</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

<p class='c009'>Yes, my dear Pierre, go. (<i>Shakes

    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>

<p class='c009'>Well, my poor Claus? Why, what

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>There’s no great harm done, Mr. Burgomaster.
They knocked me about a bit,
because I didn’t at once understand what
they wanted with me; but there’s no great
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>harm done. Luckily I had on an old shirt

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>

<p class='c009'>You know what you’re accused of?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Claus</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Yes, Mr. Burgomaster; I didn’t understand
at first, but Mr. Otto has explained.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>You and I have worked together for
over forty years, my dear old Claus, and
neither of us has anything to say against
the other. Do you trust me?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Claus</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Yes, Mr. Burgomaster.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then tell me all you know. Speak without

you say will remain between ourselves.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span><span class='sc'>Claus</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I don’t know much, Mr. Burgomaster.
I was in the nursery-garden where you told
me to go this morning; I was trimming the
rose-trees. They needed it, Mr. Burgomaster,
I can tell you, especially the Paul
Nerons, which had suckers as high as that.
And the Malmaisons and Marshal Neils
are getting the blight, Mr. Burgomaster.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The blight? I’m surprised at that; I
didn’t notice any two days ago. How
much of the insecticide have we left?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Claus</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Only a gallon or so, Mr. Burgomaster.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>That’s not enough. I’ll order some
more to-morrow.... And then what
happened?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span><span class='sc'>Claus</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then, Mr. Burgomaster, I heard a shot.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>From which side? At what distance?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Claus</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Not very far, Mr. Burgomaster. Perhaps
forty or fifty yards from where I was
working.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>And then?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Claus</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I went on with my work, Mr. Burgomaster,
saying to myself that a shot more
or less in war-time was no reason to make
me desert my rose-trees. Then I heard
shouts; I came out of the nursery, to see
what was happening; some German soldiers
saw me, fell upon me, shook me,
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>struck me and kept shouting, “Kaput!
Kaput!” Then they dragged me to the
house; and Mr. Otto rescued me from
them and locked me up in the seed-house.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>After the shot was fired, did you see no
one near you, no one running away under
the trees? Did you hear nothing, notice
nothing?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Claus</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>As you know, Mr. Burgomaster, there’s
a thick hedge all the way round the nursery
and you can’t see what happens in the
woods.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Now is there any one whom you suspect
among the workmen and gardeners? Is
there any one who has let himself go at all
and who has said things that may put us
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>on the right track? Once more, I give you
my word that all this will remain strictly
between ourselves.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Claus</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The young men, Mr. Burgomaster, the
hot-headed ones, are gone: they have all
joined the army. There’s none left here
but old men like you and me, who know
that you can’t fight against God’s will and
that any show of violence only makes
things worse for us.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Well, in the town or outside, don’t you
know of some reckless fellow who might
have committed the murder?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Claus</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>That’s not so easy to answer, Mr. Burgomaster.
But I’ve thought and thought;
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>and, since the young men are gone, there’s
no one I can think of.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c009'>You’re a Christian, Claus, you’re a religious

told me is the exact truth and that you are
keeping nothing from me?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Claus</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c009'>I may as well tell you that, if I declare

<p class='c009'>You, Mr. Burgomaster? Why?
You’ve done nothing! It’s impossible;
people don’t do such things!</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Yes, they do, my dear Claus: it’s what
they did at Aerschot, what they’ve done
everywhere and what they mean to do here
as well. Otto himself told me that nothing
could prevent it.</p>

<p class='c009'>It can’t be possible, Mr. Burgomaster,
it would be too unjust!... We shall find
the man who did it, or the man himself
when he hears, will feel ashamed and will
give himself up.... Or else you will be

Something will happen; and I am sure that
God will not permit....</p>

<p class='c009'>He permits plenty of other things, my
poor Claus; He is permitting everything
to-day. The only thing that will happen
is my death; and we may think ourselves
lucky if nothing worse happens. You
know as I do that escape is quite impossible.
Otto might try and help me, as a
last resort; but then he would be shot in
my place; and that would not be fair
either. But all hope is not lost. Otto is
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>at this moment making enquiries among
his men; that may lead to something.
You, in your turn, must collect our labourers
and speak to them. You have great
influence with them; they will listen to you.
Explain the position to them; and, if one
of them knows the guilty man, you must
arrange things among yourselves. I do
not ask them to betray him or to surrender
him. I will not mix myself up in it.
They must settle among themselves what
is the right thing to do.</p>

<p class='c009'>Otto, I have questioned Claus; I told
you that he was as innocent as you or I;
as I thought, he has no information to give
me. Can you take it upon yourself to let
him move about freely, so that he may see

which may lead to the discovery of
the murderer?</p>

<p class='c009'>(<i>Taking out his watch and looking at

Well, what have you learnt on your side?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I am feeling a little less uneasy; but
everything depends on you. To begin
with, Dr. van Cassel, of this town, has
made a hurried post-mortem examination.
It appears that the bullet entered by the
back of the neck, passed through the brain
and came out at the forehead. The bullet
has not been found. The wound shows
that it was of military calibre.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>That’s something, at any rate, for it
proves that there is no question of a sporting-gun.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Yes, but it may have been a revolver-bullet.
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>Also, I don’t believe it is possible
that one of our men committed the crime.
At the time when the shot was fired, we
had only a hundred and fifty men here, in
addition to a dozen Uhlans. The soldiers
stacked their rifles in the square and never
left the square. Six men, with their arms,
were posted in the little yard behind the
stables and they never left the yard.
These are the men who ran up after the
shot was fired. As for the Uhlans, with
the exception of two who were on sentry
duty outside the house, they were grooming
their horses in the stable of the Unicorn
Hotel. I have personally examined
the arms of those six men. They did not
look as if they had been used this morning
at all; the barrels were oiled and shiny,
they might have just come from the gunsmith’s.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It is easy enough to polish up a rifle-barrel.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Of course; but remember that the
Major will never admit that one of his men
committed the murder, unless we bring him
a concrete and undeniable proof.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>So there is nothing more to be hoped for
in that direction?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I fear not.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>That closes one more door against us.
Have you seen the Major since?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Yes; and I came away with a very hopeful
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>feeling. But, once more, everything
will depend upon yourself.... First of
all, though, here is the proclamation which
he handed me for you to sign. I may tell
you, it is already in print and will soon be
posted in the town.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Show me the proclamation.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I’ll read it to you: “A dastardly attack
having been committed on an officer
of the German army, if the culprit is not
delivered before seven o’clock this evening
precisely, the Burgomaster of the town of
Stilemonde, being responsible, will be publicly
shot at the hour aforesaid. If any
other attempt were made, the town will
be looted and set on fire; and the tenth man
of all the male inhabitants will be put to
death.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He wants me to sign that, does he?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>You must. Besides, he has taken your
consent for granted, for your signature already
appears at the foot of the sheet.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then it was scarcely worth while asking
me to sign it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It was more regular and more correct.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>

<p class='c009'>And suppose I refuse?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>You will be no better off; he will do
without and will not forgive you for refusing.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>

<p class='c009'>What more can he do than shoot me?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>You are not the only one whom he can

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>That’s true. After all, I am only signing
my own death-warrant and am wronging
nobody. (<i>Signing the paper.</i>)
There, that’s done. But wait: what about
improving the grammar a bit?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>You had better not try. He is persuaded
that it is above criticism.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>My poor Otto, I believe there’s nothing
left for me to do but make my will. It is
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>made; but I should like to revise it and
alter a few of the bequests.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Don’t say that and don’t lose courage;
you still have several chances of escape.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Really? I don’t see one.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>To begin with, there’s this: the Major
is so thoroughly convinced of Claus’s guilt
that he is quite capable of having him shot
together with yourself, if you persist in
proclaiming his innocence. He has taken
it into his head that you are absolutely
determined to save Claus from the punishment
which he deserves. In reality, he is
not at all keen on having you shot; I could
see that; he bears you no ill-will....</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>That’s very good of him....</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>But he must have an example at all costs;
on this point his mind is fully made up;
and I am bound to say that I agree with
him. I gathered that, if need be, he will
cease to demand that you should declare
Claus guilty. It will be enough for you to
keep quiet, to make no fuss and not to protest
the man’s innocence. You have only
to know nothing of what happens.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Indeed? And you, what would you do
in my place?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I should not hesitate. After all, as
there are two innocent men, why should
you, who are unquestionably the more innocent
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>of the two, be the one to suffer? We
are at war; war brings strokes of good and
bad luck which have nothing in common
with the chances of ordinary life. Those
upon whom ill-luck falls can only accept
their fate. The others are not responsible
for an injustice in which they have no more
share, in which they take no more part
than, let me say, in the injustice of a bridge
that breaks down or a factory-chimney that
falls to the ground, burying a dozen victims
in its ruins.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>All this is much too subtle for me. I
see and understand one thing only: Claus
is innocent. If I do not declare the fact
aloud, by your Major’s own decision my
silence becomes tantamount to a formal
accusation and, to save my own life, I shall
be sending a man whom I know to be innocent
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>to face the firing-party. Is there a
name for that action in German?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>You refuse to understand. Whatever
happens, from your point of view an injustice
is bound to be committed. The question
is who shall be the victim, you or
Claus. Why should you die rather than
he?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>And why he rather than I?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Because he has been appointed by fate,
chance, destiny, or whatever you like to
call it. You are not responsible for his
death; and there is no reason why you
should shout, like Nisis, “I, I am here, I
did it! Let me die in his stead!” This
is not the time and place for theatrical display
or inopportune heroism.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>You are quite right; and, if, in order to
save Claus, I went and said to the Major,
“You need look no further, it is I who
killed the Lieutenant,” I should, as you
say, be making a display of inopportune
heroism for which I am not at all fitted.
There is nothing of the hero about me; I
am just a poor, respectable man, like the
other men of this town; like the other men,
I fear death; and I am as much attached to
life as any one else, indeed perhaps more,
for my life hitherto has been happier than
I deserved. I should like to end it as
calmly as possible, but even so, I want to
end it decently. It is all very well for you
to say that Claus, innocent as he is, must
die because he has been selected by fate
and that I am not responsible for what happens
to him. But I too am selected by
fate! If an unlucky chance brought him
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>on the scene of the murder, a similar and
equally unlucky chance has placed me at the
head of this town at a moment of terrible
responsibility and danger. Our position,
looked at from the point of view of ill-luck
and of the excuse which you are trying
to find in destiny, is absolutely the same.
If Claus had in his hands the power which
I have in mine, if my life or death depended
on his evidence alone and if, knowing
me to be innocent, he proclaimed me
guilty, you would consider him a monster
or the meanest of cowards; yet he would
be doing exactly what you wish me to do.
He and I are both marked down, to the
same extent, by the same fatality and we
stand an equal chance; but you are urging
me to cheat and to take an unfair advantage
against a decent man who cannot protect
himself and who trusts me. I should
be only too glad to be convinced by what
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>you say, but that is out of the question;
and I cannot understand how you yourself
do not understand!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Very well, let us drop argument, since
you will not listen to reason. Let us admit
that the position is the same in both cases;
but, as a choice has to be made between
two lives, would you consider your own,
which is useful and necessary to all, of no
more value than that of a poor devil who
has no relations, no children, no one to regret
him, who does no public service and
who will soon be a burden to the community?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Old Claus’s life is worth just as much
as mine; and my answer would be the same
if, instead of being the respectable, God-fearing
man that he is, he were the lowest
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>of scoundrels. It is here a question not
of weighing the value or the usefulness of
a man’s life, but of knowing whether or not
I am to dishonour my own.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>You really amaze me! You scarcely

did me the honour to entrust me with his
daughter!</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I will be fairer and more reasonable
than you are; and I do not abandon the
hope of saving you in spite of yourself.
You have time for reflection; you have
three hours before you; and I shall see
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>that you are free to make your choice until
the very last minute.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>My choice is made. The longer I reflect,
the more clearly I shall see that any
decent man in my place would do as I am
doing and that I cannot do otherwise.
(<i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Claus</span>.) But here comes Claus,
bringing us news, which perhaps will show
how futile all this discussion has been.
Well, Claus, what have you heard?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Claus</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I’ll tell you, Mr. Burgomaster. I called
my gardeners into the palm-house. They
were all there except old Decoster, who is
ill in bed, and the young men who left a
fortnight ago. I told them what had happened
and what was going to happen.
They understood and they were wild with
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>indignation. I saw quite plainly that they
knew nothing and could do nothing. And
I also know that, if the guilty man was
among them, they would have no need to
accuse him and to hand him over. He
would have handed himself over. They
all had tears in their eyes, Mr. Burgomaster,
and in their hearts something of
which I won’t speak, in Mr. Otto’s presence.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I was sure of it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Claus</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>And now, Mr. Burgomaster, may I
make a suggestion? I will say this in
Mr. Otto’s presence, for there is no harm
in his repeating it to the Major.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>What is it, Claus?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span><span class='sc'>Claus</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It’s like this, Mr. Burgomaster; I’ve
been thinking things over. I’m an old
man, I shall be sixty-three by the end of
next month. I’m a widower, Mr. Burgomaster,
and I have no children. I suffer a
good deal; and my life, which is nearly
finished, isn’t worth much, Mr. Burgomaster.
So I said to myself, Mr. Burgomaster,
“Claus, old man, seeing that you were
found near the Lieutenant who was killed,
it would perhaps be better if you did not
say that it wasn’t you who killed him.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then you admit that you killed him?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Claus</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>No, Mr. Otto, I can’t admit that I killed
him, because I didn’t. I have only to say
nothing next time they accuse me. Or
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>else I will ask the Major to have me shot
instead of the Burgomaster. The Burgomaster’s
life is necessary to everybody here,
especially at this time, whereas mine is no
longer of much use to anybody.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>You see? It’s exactly what I said.
There’s no more ground for hesitation.
This good man understands his duty and

give me your hand.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Claus</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>(<i>Withdrawing his hand.</i>) No, Mr.
Otto, excuse me. I have been digging up
the ground and I should soil your white
gloves.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>

<p class='c009'>I not only want to shake both your
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>hands, though they be covered with earth,
but I want to take you in my arms as I
would a brother, my dear old Claus.
(<i>Clasps him in his arms.</i>) And now let
there be no more question of all this.
What you propose to do is very beautiful
and, coming from you, does not astonish
me at all; but it is not practicable. To
begin with, I have no right to accept your
sacrifice. It is very fine of you to offer it,
but it would be mean and hateful of me to
accept it. Besides, if I did accept it, unless
you formally declared yourself guilty, it is
pretty nearly certain that the Major on his
side would refuse it. What he wants, in
order to make a striking example, is not
your life, but mine, or the murderer’s.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Claus</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I will say anything that I have to, so as
to die in your place, Mr. Burgomaster.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>(<i>To the</i> <span class='sc'>Burgomaster</span>.) In that case,
the Major will accept; I’ll answer for him.
Leave it to me and look upon yourself as
saved.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>But don’t you see that it’s the same thing
as before, that it means handing over an
innocent man to execution and that, the
more you try to obscure it, the clearer my
duty becomes? If I will not permit Claus
to die voluntarily in my stead while declaring
himself innocent, still less can I allow
him to do so by declaring himself guilty,
when I know that he is not. That would
be committing two mean actions instead of
one.</p>

<p class='c009'>Claus, stay here. You love me, my
dear old Claus: you have just given me the
most beautiful and positive proof that one
man can give to another. I will ask you
for yet another proof, perhaps even more
trying; it shall be the last. Promise me
that, whatever happens, you will not go to
the Major.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c001'>
    <div><i>Scene: The same.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><i>The curtain rises on the</i> <span class='sc'>Burgomaster</span>,
<i>the</i> <span class='sc'>Secretary</span>, <span class='sc'>Isabelle</span> <i>and</i>
<span class='sc'>Floris</span>.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c001'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>As you were not present at the meeting,
Mr. Secretary, I will tell you what was
decided. The question of the war-levy
and of the fine inflicted on the town for the
death of Lieutenant von Schaunberg is settled.
The Major demanded five hundred
thousand francs for the levy and two millions
for the fine....</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span><span class='sc'>Floris</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Two hundred thousand times what he
was worth!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>There’s no doubt about that.... I
persuaded the Major, not without difficulty,
to agree to a lump sum of a million,
which must be paid before midday to-morrow.
I have in my safe fifty thousand
francs in cash, which I place at the disposal
of the town. De Cuyper’s Bank will pay
us two hundred and fifty thousand francs,
Sheriff van den Bulke fifty thousand and
Councillor de Rudder seventy-five thousand
francs. That makes nearly half a million
certain. Sheriff Vermandel will try to get
the rest of the money from the town-councillors
and the leading inhabitants.
You will assist him in his efforts. Everything
therefore is more or less settled; and
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>I can go without too much anxiety. The
conditions are hard, but, taken all round,
they are better than I hoped; and Stilemonde
will not suffer unduly from the occupation.
In any case, its fate is almost enviable,
compared with that of many other
towns. It owes this favour largely to
Otto’s presence. He really did all he could
without dangerously compromising himself.
I want to recognize this in your
presence and to do him justice.... I
have said good-bye to the sheriffs, the councillors
and all my friends at the Town-hall.
I was very much touched; I had no idea
that they cared so much for me. Sheriff
Vermandel was really quite distressing:
I’ve never seen a man look so sad. He
clung to me, wanted to die in my place.
I had the greatest difficulty in making him
understand that it was not his turn and
that his sacrifice would be impossible and
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>useless. Father de Coninck, the Rector of
St. John the Baptist’s, arrived at the end
of the meeting and asked the Major why
he had not taken him for a hostage as well
as myself. He said that it was an honour
to which he was entitled. Splendid of
him, the way he demanded his share. The
Major replied that he would lose nothing
by waiting. Say what you will, there are
good men left in the world. (<i>Looking at
the clock.</i>) Half-past five. We have an
hour and a half before us. But you have
no time to lose, my dear Pierre; go and see
to your affairs. I will wait here with my
children until Otto returns. By the way,
what has become of our wounded soldier,
your friend Gilson? We have been forgetting
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Firmin put him in the chauffeur’s room.
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>I looked in there a moment ago. He was
sleeping soundly, like a child, and he knows
nothing.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>

<p class='c009'>So much the better. Be sure and keep

might commit some imprudence.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>(<i>Shaking hands with him.</i>) <i>Au revoir.</i>
Yes, perhaps we shall see each other again.
(<i>Exit the</i> <span class='sc'>Secretary</span>.) Otto has gone to
make a last appeal to the Major. I have
no great hope of his succeeding. I shall
be leaving you soon, my dears, and I want
to give you my last injunctions.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>(<span class='sc'>Isabelle</span> <i>and</i> <span class='sc'>Floris</span> <i>fling themselves

    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>(<i>Caressing them tenderly.</i>) Don’t cry,
dears; the time has not yet come. But we
must provide for everything. My will is
with Van Overloop, the solicitor. I have
added certain safeguards against Otto,
who, after all, is not a member of the family.
You will find in the safe, over and
above the fifty thousand francs put aside
for the payment of the fine, ten thousand
francs in ready money, which will enable
you to live till better times come. Here,
Isabelle, is the key. Don’t mention those
ten thousand francs, either of you, to Otto.
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>Isabelle’s position will be very difficult
after the war. Flemish people have long
memories and the national hatred will be
so great that Otto will not be able to show
his face here again.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hold your tongue, Floris; show some

But here comes Otto; he will tell

<p class='c009'>(<i>Running towards him.</i>) Well? Did

    <div><span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Not a thing! I begged, entreated,
dragged myself at his feet, did and said
what not another German officer would
have done. Not a thing, not a thing!
He ended by commanding my silence in
such a tone that it was impossible to insist.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Isabelle</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>You must try again! You give in too
soon: that’s not the way to obtain what one
wants! If you had let me go with you, as
I implored you, he would have ended by
yielding, I know he would! After all, he
may be a German, but he’s a man, for all
that! Come along. I want to go with
you. If you won’t come, I’ll go alone!</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span><span class='sc'>Isabelle</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Did you say all there was to say? You
have influence in Germany; your family
is rich and powerful; you’ve told me so
again and again. You must frighten him,
make him feel uneasy, threaten him, anything!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Threaten him! You don’t realize; you
don’t know what things are. I saw that
his patience was exhausted.... But I
haven’t told you everything. There’s
something else, something worse.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Isabelle</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c009'>Something worse? Worse than what?
What can be worse than death?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Yes, he has discovered something worse;
and perhaps it is not his fault. He is, as
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>we all are, the slave of discipline and of
the military regulations. He does not like
me as much, perhaps, as he liked von
Schaunberg, for I don’t belong to his class.
But I do not believe that he wishes me any
ill. He was always a little distant to me,
perhaps, but on the whole, up to now, he
has been very just. He is not a bad sort
of man; he is one of our most humane officers;
but what he wants to make me do is
terrible.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Isabelle</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>But what is it, what? There is nothing
more for us to fear. Nothing worse can
happen than what has happened already.
He is not going to revive torture, I suppose?
Does he want more victims?
There are no lives more precious than our
father’s. Does he want you and me? I
would rather have that. We will all die
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>together. Of what good will life be, after
this?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He does not ask for other victims, but
his orders are.... No, I can’t say it, I
daren’t say it, to you!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Isabelle</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c009'>But what is it that he wants? Do

can’t have dared! It’s impossible! And
you didn’t rebel, you didn’t lash him across
the face, you didn’t cut him down with your
sword, your eyes said nothing of what was
passing in your soul? I refuse to believe
it! There has been nothing like this in
any war in history! Why, it’s not
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>possible! It’s only a test! He wanted to
find out how far he could go; but he knows
quite well that no man, no man in the
world, not even a German, could agree to
that!... Well, what did you answer?
I hope that by this time he knows what
to expect and that, though you have had
the misfortune to be born in Germany, you

<p class='c009'>The worst of it is that he is obliged to

<p class='c009'>That’s something, at last! It’s the first

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c009'>He told me that he would give me till

<p class='c009'>Come, come, stop this fooling and let
us talk sense. We must not lose our self-control.
The Major is a monster, a brute,
anything you please; but, placed as he is,
he’s right. He’s obeying the regulations;
and, again in his position, he can’t act differently....
I will ask Otto once again,
is it quite certain that he will not reconsider
his decision? People often change
their minds at the last moment; and even
the most obstinate man will let himself
think.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He won’t do it. In anything relating
to the army orders, he is inflexible. Besides,
on second thoughts, I am not sure
that I did not go too far just now when
I said that he had nothing against me. I
have sometimes observed a certain ill-will,
almost a certain animosity, where I was
concerned. I don’t quite know to what
to ascribe it. It may be that the plebeian
prosperity of my family offends his patrician
poverty. It may be that, as I took
my wife from this country, he suspects me
of being too fond of its inhabitants. Or,
more likely still, he may have other reasons
into which I do not care to enter. The
fact remains that he would not be sorry
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>to find me at fault or at least to put me
to the test and to make that test a striking
example, which will teach our soldiers once
more what German discipline can do.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought of that. He refused peremptorily,

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>

<p class='c009'>Is that what you wish, Isabelle? He

    <div><span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It is not sure that they will permit you
to die with us.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Isabelle</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It would certainly be the first time that
they had spared a woman. You need have
no fear on that score. In any case, this
is my affair; and we need say no more about
that.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>

<p class='c009'>Do you accept, Otto?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I accept, in so far as I am concerned,

I do not agree to letting my death involve
Isabelle’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>Therefore, by ordering you to disobey,
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>Isabelle is sending you to face the firing-party.
She has no right to do that, unless
she is absolutely determined not to
survive you. If a woman deliberately and
of her own free will—for that is what
you are doing, Isabelle—sends a man to
his death and does not go with him, after
explicitly promising to share his fate, then
she is guilty of one of the most odious
and cowardly acts of treachery which she
could possibly commit. Reflect, both of
you. It is a question of taking, in my
presence, a solemn and irrevocable pledge.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Isabelle</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then Otto will die in an hour’s time

    <div><span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span><span class='sc'>Isabelle</span></div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Do you accept, Otto?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Otto</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I accept, since Isabelle wishes it.</p>

<p class='c013'>(<i>A pause.</i>)</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Good. Each of you is worthy of the
other. You have proved to me that you
love me and that you love each other
better than life.... Now that the proof
is established and your sacrifice fulfilled
as much as though death had come to you,
we have nothing more to fear and we can
speak freely. In all this nightmare there
is only one death which is necessary and
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>inevitable; and that is mine. Your own
deaths depend only upon ourselves, that
is to say, they must not take place....
Isabelle, my darling, if I were lying on my
death-bed at this moment, you would not
refuse to hear and carry out my last wishes.
I am before you now, standing on my feet,
but as near to my end as though I were
stretched upon a bed of sickness. (<i>The
clock strikes six.</i>) Hark! Six o’clock!
You see how close it is. Besides, I have
what dying men, whose minds are often
dulled, do not always have, the full possession
of my mental faculties. The wish
which I am about to express, the request
which I am about to make of both of you,
must therefore be all the more sacred.
Do you promise me, Isabelle, as you would
promise a dying man, to perform piously
what I am going to ask of you?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span><span class='sc'>Isabelle</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I know beforehand what you are going
to ask; and I cannot promise you to order
the man I married to become the murderer
of his father and mine.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Isabelle, at a moment like this we must
not juggle with words which do not express
what they say and which distort the
truth most dreadfully. Otto has revealed
to us the only truth that counts, by proving
that he is ready to sacrifice his life not
only to save mine, if that were possible,
but even to spare you the pain of seeing
him become the instrument—to some
extent the accidental, involuntary, irresponsible
instrument—of my death.
It is for you and me to show ourselves
worthy of that sacrifice by not accepting
it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span><span class='sc'>Isabelle</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>If I did not accept it, I should not be
worthy of being your daughter.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Burgomaster</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Words, more words, Isabelle, which do
not touch the truth. We have no time to
waste on sentences which do not say the
things that have to be said. The minutes
are slipping by, there are very few left;
and I should not like to die before convincing
you. Otto—you know it as well
as I do—is caught in the cogs of the machine
and cannot extricate himself. This
is enough to justify him. He is no more
responsible for the harm which he will do
me than the sword which he carries or the
twelve rifles which will discharge their bullets
at me. We must look at things as
they are and rise above hackneyed phrases
and theories which show things to us as
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>they are not. If his refusal could delay
my execution for a day, for an hour, I
could in the last resort understand your
decision; but it will not delay it for three
minutes. Whether it be he or another
who gives the word of command, the ten
or twelve bullets that enter my body will
do it the same hurt.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have done my duty, Isabelle, and you
have approved. I have made the sacrifice
of my life; and I have made it much
more easily than I dared hope, for I did
not know that I had so much courage.
But I am no hero; I am only a poor man
who was quite unprepared to do what I
am going to do to-day. You must not ask
too much of me. There are limits to my
strength. I am not used to suffering, I
have not been in the habit of braving misfortune.
I can bear my own unhappiness,
but not that of others; and I feel that I
shall not hold out to the end without breaking
down, if my death is to involve the loss
of the most precious of the lives which I
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>thought I had ransomed. You must spare
me one intolerable sorrow that can still
move me. You ought to understand this.
You ought to help me. And, instead of
helping me, you are both of you making
it more difficult for me! Don’t you want
your father to hold up his head when he
faces the enemy? I was not afraid of
death for myself, but I am for you. Do
not weaken the strength which I shall need
very soon. I have made the sacrifice of
my own life, but not of your two lives:
that would mean a twofold death to me
and threefold suffering; and the courage
which I have called up will not be enough
if I see you fall by my side.</p>

<p class='c009'>And both of us be caught before we

would be the same; only it would be
less seemly. And, if I did succeed in escaping,
too many others would pay the
penalty. Of all the chances of safety, this
obviously is the only one that must on no
account be attempted. No, I am driven
into a corner, I am marked down; it is all
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>over; and you must look upon me as dead.
I have come to the end of my days; those
which were worth living are past. I am
not dying too soon; I had nothing more to
wait for. Instead of a lingering, troublesome
death, a painful, miserable death on
a bed, I am offered a quick and sudden
end, an honourable end, free from thought
or suffering, and one which perhaps will
save half the town. I should be mad to
hesitate or to regret not dying in my bed.
I too have been afraid of death. If any
one had ever told me that one evening
I should have to face it as I am doing
now, I should not have dared to go on
living. Whereas now I hardly give it a
thought; I have to make an effort, to force
myself, to concentrate my mind upon it in
order to realize that, after all, perhaps it
is somewhat serious and not what we had
expected. Looked at from a distance,
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>death seems like some horrible mountain,
which shuts out the horizon; but, as we
draw near, it dwindles and sinks away;
and, when we are face to face with it, it
is nothing.</p>

you instead of pressing you to my heart.
Yes or no, will you do what I ask? I
appeal to Otto: his silence shows that he
understands. He sees things now as you
will see them later, as I see them and as
we are bound to see them. One day you
will thank us both for not listening to you

and there are certain precautions which we

am not asking you to forget: that does
not depend on yourself. Nor to forgive
Otto: there is nothing to forgive. I simply
ask you not to shut him out from your
heart. Is that a promise also?</p>

<p class='c009'>(<i>Faintly.</i>) Yes.</p>

<p class='c009'>He is more to be pitied than either of
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>us two. He is bearing the chief burden
of this dreadful ordeal; and I doubt if, in
his place, I should have the strength to
bear that burden. We must have pity.
You will learn, slowly, to love him once
more as you have loved him until this
day.... Besides, you will probably soon
become a mother. The child that is to be
born must not become the last and most
sorrowful victim of this tragedy. I know
that, at first, life will be very sad for you
and very difficult. Wait patiently. Listen
humbly to what it says. Life is always
right. It is full of indulgence and
good-will and very soon forgets what
should be forgotten. (<i>The clock strikes
seven.</i>) Seven o’clock. I hear some one
knocking at the door. My time is up.
They have come to fetch us, Otto. Let
us embrace each other for the last time,
Isabelle. Come to my arms, Floris.
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>You’re a man now. I entrust your sister
to you. We have been very fond of one
another.... Come, Otto, we must not
